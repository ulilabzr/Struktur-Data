# Data Structures – C++

This repository contains fundamental data structure implementations written in C++. The code was created for academic coursework and personal practice, and can also be used as a reference for learning.

## 📂 Repository Contents
The project may include implementations of:

- Linked List (Singly / Doubly)
- Stack
- Queue
- Tree
- Graph
- Arrays / Vectors
- Basic Sorting & Searching (if applicable)

Each file or folder typically represents one data structure and its related operations.

## 🎯 Purpose
This repository aims to:

- Understand core data structure concepts
- Practice programming with C++
- Support coursework and lab assignments

## ▶️ How to Run
Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., `g++`, MinGW, or IDE-based tools).

Compile and run a file using:

```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o output
./output
